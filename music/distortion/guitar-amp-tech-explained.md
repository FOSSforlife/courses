Comment explaining the Class A, AB, etc in further detail: [(Source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7NpuKAl7jg&lc=Ugz6r2dH4dXeKqPYVEV4AaABAg)

> In SE, one device supplies the full load current. In PP, the load current is the difference between the currents flowing through two devices. The Class (A/B/AB) determines how much of the signal's cycle the devices conduct during. Class A = 360 deg, Class B = 180 deg, Class AB = 180-360 deg.

> These concepts are not specific to tubes which is why I don't mention them and use a generic triangle symbol. The triangle can be a tube or a transistor, it doesn't matter. The load can be a speaker or the reflected impedance of the speaker via an output transformer. If I added all those details it would make everything more complicated, but it wouldn't change the theory!


> @Rajani Amps  thank you for the all explanation. I had a question: the value of grid resistors used in most Fender blackface has a value of 470 Ohm (connected to B+2 supply). What exactaly they does? And in relationship with the plate voltage and current, what happens if we increase the value for these resistor to a, let’s say, 2K7 or more? The final power output could be reduced? Tone could be changed? The power tubes could be damaged? I have already saw some Mesa Boogies that have switches for pentode/triode modes and I saw increased values for those B+2 source grid resistors. I think this could be a good topic for a new video.


> @Emanoel Raiff Nóbrega  Those screen-grid resistors limit the current through the screens, which protects them from melting during overdrive conditions. They also have the side-effect of lowering the screen voltage as the average current demand increases (in the Class B region) which dynamically changes the operating point of the tube. If you make them larger, then you will get more sag, more compression, more nonlinear distortion as well as less output power and less headroom.

> Tubes in Fender amps like 6L6/6V6 draw less screen current compared to EL34/84 and so require less screen resistance for protection. That's why EL34 amps tend to have higher value screen resistors (1-2K compared to 470R-1K for 6L6). You won't damage the tube by increasing the screen resistor. You just have to make sure the screen resistor is adequately rated, ideally to handle not just the class B operating mode during heavy overdrive, but also a short-circuit tube failure mode in the time it takes for the fuse to blow!
